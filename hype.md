# Wailsx - A Testable, Idiomatic Wrapper for Wails

I love [Wails](https://wails.io) and have been using it to create some great applications. Unfortunately, the Wails `v2` API is not very testable or idiomatic. Wailsx is a wrapper around the Wails API that makes it easier to test and use in a more idiomatic way.
